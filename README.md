# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect credit card fraud using a dataset containing historical transactions.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Saved trained machine learning models.
- `src/`: Python scripts for utility functions and preprocessing steps.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `README.md`: Project overview, instructions, and details.

## Dependencies
